# QiDao-POAP-Design---Ask-Me-Anything
Thank you for organizing this amazing competition, please see all the uploaded pictures.

When performing the first layout, I started from the importance of simplicity, which gives us greater recognition, memorability, calmness and pacification.

Then I decided to modify the main character, which seems to me to look more modern and youthful - big eyes make us fall in love with the character, attract attention and inspire more trust. Uniqueness of the character, nothing superfluous - eyes, mouth and beard referring to the great philosopher Lao Zi.

We got:
- Word AMA is present in the design 
- The design is flexible, by means of small changes you can add various topics, icons or illustrations, partners, etc. 
- The simplicity of the character's image allows us to easily change his emotions, hand poses, eye gaze
